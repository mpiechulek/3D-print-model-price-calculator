# 3D-print-model-price-calculator

One of my hobbies is 3D design. I've recently bought a 3D printer. The first question form my frends was: how much does a 3D prit cost? It gave me an idea to create a simple calculator to calculate cost of 3D prints.

Userâ€™s guide:

1.	Enter the total cost of filament roll.
2.	Enter the total weight of the filament on the roll (without the roll).
3.	Enter the 3D print weight.
4.	Enter the average power consumption of your printer.
5.	Enter the average power cost of 1kWh.
6.	Enter the print time in hours and minutes (e.g. 0 hours and 30 minutes).
