# 3D-print-model-price-calculator


One of my hobbys is 3D design. I've recently got a 3D printer. The first question form my frends was, how much does a 3D prit costs. It gave me the idea to create a simple calculator to calculate costs of 3D prints.

Users guide:
1. Enter the total cost of filament roll.
2. Enter the total weight of the filament on the roll(without the roll).
3. Enter the 3D pritn weight.
4. Enter the average power consumption of you printer.
5. Enter the average power cost of 1kWh.
6. Eneter the print time  in hours and minutes (example 0 hours and 30 minutes).
